    "  - Open the blog page on the web.\n",
    "  - Implement A/B Testing to show different versions of the page to users.\n",
    "  - Add a feature to collect user email subscriptions on each page.\n",

    "  - **View**: Represents the user interface, including text, buttons, etc. (e.g., web pages).\n",

    "- Create two versions of the blog page with only the title changed.\n",
    "- Implement logic to randomly show one of the two versions (A: 50%, B: 50%) when accessing the same routing path.\n",
    "  - Log the user's IP address and access time.\n",
    "- Collect and save email addresses upon subscription.\n",
    "  - Ensure that the same blog page is shown for a user after subscription, and the subscription modal no longer appears.\n",
    "  \n",
    "> **Purpose**: After implementing the service, analyzing logs can help determine which blog title attracts more subscribers.<br>This approach can be extended to create a variety of blog services."
