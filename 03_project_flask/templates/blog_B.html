            <h2>Why Did I Become a Developer?</h2>
            <p>
              During my freshman year in college, I found myself more drawn to introductory programming courses like C++ and Java rather than my major subjects in electrical and electronics engineering. 
              While working night shifts at a convenience store, I would solve programming problems by writing them on the back of discarded receipts. 
              Looking back now, they were simple problems, but at the time, solving each one brought me immense joy and excitement, pulling me deeply into the world of programming.
              By the time I was about to graduate, I had maintained good grades in my major while achieving a strong understanding of programming, recognized as one of the most proficient in my department.
              This expertise greatly aided me in completing my graduation project, where I combined electronic circuits with a C# GUI program to create a comprehensive and integrated final product.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>My First Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>
              My first career began at a Korean company developing defense systems. Having only worked with the WinForm framework before, I was introduced to WPF, a completely new framework. 
              Although I hadn’t fully mastered WinForm yet, I was also required to consider the MVVM design pattern alongside WPF, which presented a significant challenge. 
              Fortunately, I felt joy at the opportunity to learn and utilize a new framework.
              Initially, it was tough to understand, but the repeated process of analyzing code and creating my own solutions brought me a sense of achievement.
              Beyond WPF, I also started incorporating commercial SDKs into projects, applying mathematical concepts like Naive Bayes, 3D unit vectors, and 3D distance calculations to create new features tailored to customer requirements.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>My Second Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>
              My second career was in a completely different industry from my first. Other than continuing to use C#, everything else was new. 
              The unfamiliarity of factory automation systems was challenging, but what made it even harder were the specialized terminologies unique to the industry.
              Furthermore, high security levels made obtaining related information nearly impossible.
              What seemed simple at first often required understanding an overwhelming number of terms and concepts, making it difficult to adapt.
              After joining, I repeatedly learned these terms and imagined the internal structure of the systems to develop my hypotheses.
              While my hypotheses weren’t always correct, they gradually aligned with reality. Eventually, I became capable of diagnosing system issues and identifying their root causes.
              By running simulations, I could determine solutions that addressed both the problems and their underlying causes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Challenges in My Second Job</h3>
            <p>
              Understanding CAN communication and electric vehicle battery packs in my second job was extremely challenging. 
              The first reason was the specialized nature of the industry, which made finding knowledgeable people difficult. 
              As a result, I spent a lot of time experimenting with specialized tools and reflecting on their operation during my personal time.
              The second reason was that battery packs appeared simple on the surface but involved numerous considerations. 
              Analyzing even a single model required a lot of time, and I needed to understand multiple models. 
              Although I automated sequences to account for all conditions, exceptions constantly arose, teaching me the hard way that automation is never foolproof. 
              Issues could arise from software I developed due to high-current noise, from the battery pack itself, or even from the automation equipment.
              These problems were often invisible and couldn’t always be replicated due to inconsistent conditions. 
              By transforming every challenge into personal growth, I became a valuable asset not only within my company but also to our clients.
            </p>
            <h3>Leadership and Corporate Management</h3>
            <p>
              In 2022, I was promoted to the head of a Hungarian subsidiary of a Korean company. 
              Taking on the role of managing director presented a significantly different set of responsibilities and challenges compared to my previous developer roles. 
              At the same time, I continued handling development tasks, which necessitated efficient time and resource management.

              The most challenging aspect of this period was the constant pressure of being held accountable for every issue. 
              Balancing the demands of clients, corporate headquarters, and team members was no easy feat. 
              The burden of responsibility, especially when problems arose, often kept me awake at night. 
              Even minor mistakes could impact the overall operation of the subsidiary, keeping me in a state of perpetual vigilance.

              However, these experiences taught me invaluable lessons. 
              I came to appreciate the importance of balanced decision-making, striving to propose reasonable solutions and earn trust among different stakeholders. 
              Through this process, I honed my problem-solving and communication skills significantly. 
              Additionally, I learned the importance of delegating tasks to team members and fostering collaboration based on mutual trust.

              The most profound realization was that it’s impossible to control every issue perfectly. 
              The key was to respond calmly and rationally to problems and work collaboratively with my team to find solutions. 
              Through repeated experiences, I learned how to grow under pressure and turn accountability into an opportunity for personal development.

              Ultimately, these challenging experiences strengthened my leadership abilities. 
              Looking back, I believe these difficulties shaped me into a more mature individual capable of confidently tackling any future challenges.

            <h3>My Dream: Building My First Blog</h3>
            <p>
              So far, my career has revolved around developing Windows applications and software. 
              However, I have always been intrigued by the idea of building my own webpage and learning about the technologies and frameworks other software developers use. 
              In pursuit of this curiosity, I discovered ASP.NET and began planning what I could achieve with it.
              My initial goal was to create my own blog to showcase my career journey. ASP.NET, MVC patterns, Frontend frameworks like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and others—all of these were new to me.
              Before starting the project, I had vague fears like "Where do I even begin?" or "Can I do this well?" But by defining the necessary features and gradually studying how to implement them, I built my blog step by step.
              After completing the development, I considered how to make it accessible to others. I discovered that deploying it as a Docker image on my personal NAS would make it viewable by others.
              Instead of using the default domain provided by the NAS, I learned about domain hosting, purchased my own domain, and configured it for use.
              Later, to enhance the blog's design, I applied Frontend frameworks like Bootstrap and React.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>My Ambition: Earning a Master’s Degree</h3>
            <p>
              One question I frequently encountered early in my career was, "Why software development when you majored in electrical engineering?" 
              While my second company appreciated my dual expertise in electrical engineering and software, this question often came up before I had proven myself.
              During my undergraduate studies, I frequently doubted my choice of major, as I was more passionate about programming than electrical engineering. 
              However, despite these doubts, I continued to excel academically and maintain my curiosity about programming.

              After completing my freshman year, I enlisted in the military (like all Korean men). During my service, I read books about information processing and suddenly felt a desire to pursue a master’s degree after graduation.
              However, financial constraints forced me to prioritize starting my career over further education. 
              Although I wanted to study part-time while working, the location of my workplace made it infeasible.

              After transferring to a second company, being dispatched to Hungary, and settling into life there, the pandemic led to an increase in online part-time courses.
              I seized this opportunity to start studying for a master’s degree in AI. 
              Balancing work abroad with academic studies was undoubtedly challenging, but it allowed me to acquire in-depth knowledge and experience through discussions and projects.
              While I’ve only scratched the surface of machine learning and deep learning, I feel a little more confident now. 
              The vastness of the field makes me humble, as even the limited areas I studied were enormous and impossible to fully grasp.
            </p>
            <h3>C#: A Journey to Python</h3>
            <p>
              My professional experience has been predominantly built around C# as my primary programming language. While SQL was also integral to my career, my expertise has been centered on C#. 
              I’ve always believed that one should "not spend 10 years doing what they learned in just one year" and that "when learning stops, life also stops."
              This mindset has driven me to continuously explore new tools and technologies, fostering my growth as a developer.

              When I began my master’s studies, I realized that Python was essential in the fields of AI and machine learning. 
              Although I had never worked with Python before, my academic and professional interests motivated me to tackle this new language. 
              Initially, stepping out of my comfort zone was daunting, but Python's simplicity and robust library ecosystem quickly won me over.

              Python became an indispensable tool for text analysis, building machine learning models, and deep learning. 
              Libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, as well as TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning, made my research and projects far more efficient. 
              Through this experience, I came to understand that "a programming language is just a tool, and true developer qualities lie in problem-solving skills and a learning mindset."

              Today, Python is more than just a new language to me—it has opened doors to the world of AI and data analytics. 
              This journey has added a new chapter to my career, and I aim to leverage both C# and Python, along with various other technologies, to contribute to a broader range of fields as I continue to grow.
            </p>
            <h3>Embracing New Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              Whenever I start learning something new, I often wonder, "Can I really do this well?" or "Where should I begin?" 
              Over time, I’ve realized that the best answer to these questions is simply to start.
              While the beginning is always tough, taking that first step reveals the next, and as I persist step by step, my experiences snowball into invaluable assets. 
              This process fills me with a sense of accomplishment, which becomes the driving force for my next challenge.

              New challenges go beyond acquiring skills or knowledge; they test and expand my limits. 
              The exhilaration I feel during this process is something I deeply cherish and is the reason I continuously seek growth.

              Recently, I’ve become interested in fields outside of development, such as marketing, sales, and design. 
              However, I also understand the importance of prioritization and the risk of overextending myself, so I’m approaching these interests cautiously. 
              Nevertheless, I plan to delve into these areas in the near future. 
              I believe that these new challenges will broaden my perspective and help me grow into a more well-rounded professional with diverse expertise.
