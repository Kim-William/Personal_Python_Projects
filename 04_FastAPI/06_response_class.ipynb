    "# 5.7 FastAPI Response Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition and Purpose of FastAPI Response Classes\n",
    "- **Definition**: Classes that define different types of HTTP responses.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To control the format of returned data and fine-tune HTTP response behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## List of Major Response Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. JSONResponse\n",
    "- **Usage**: Returns data in JSON format.\n",
    "- **Feature**: Converts Python dictionaries or Pydantic models into JSON strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. HTMLResponse\n",
    "- **Usage**: Returns data in HTML format.\n",
    "- **Application**: Used mainly for returning web page content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. PlainTextResponse\n",
    "- **Usage**: Returns responses in plain text format.\n",
    "- **Application**: Suitable for logging or simple message transmissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. RedirectResponse\n",
    "- **Usage**: Redirects the client to another URL.\n",
    "- **Application**: Used when guiding users to a different page.\n",

    "## JSONResponse Example Code\n",
    "[Reference Link](#)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/json\", response_class=JSONResponse)\n",
    "def read_json():\n",
    "    return {\"msg\": \"This is JSON\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the server: uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The `/json` route uses `JSONResponse` to return data in JSON format.\n",
    "- The returned dictionary is automatically converted into JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "### curl Test Command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X GET \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/json\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Test Method**: Sends a GET request to the `/json` endpoint, returning a response formatted as JSON.\n",
    "- **Expected Output**: \n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  {\"msg\": \"This is JSON\"}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using various response classes in FastAPI allows developers to control the format of returned data efficiently, fine-tune HTTP response behaviors, and enhance API flexibility.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Purpose and Features of HTMLResponse\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Returns data in HTML format.\n",
    "- **Feature**: Used to return a portion or the entirety of an HTML page.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Run the server: uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The `/html` route uses `HTMLResponse` to return data in HTML format.\n",
    "- It is used for sending HTML markup to clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### curl Test Command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X GET \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/html\"\n",

    "## 3. PlainTextResponse Example Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose and Features of PlainTextResponse\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Returns responses in plain text format.\n",
    "- **Application**: Suitable for logging messages, simple instructions, and text responses.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Run the server: uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The `/text` route uses `PlainTextResponse` to return a simple text response.\n",
    "- Ideal for log messages or plain-text API responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### curl Test Command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X GET \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/text\"\n",

    "## 4. RedirectResponse Example Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose and Features of RedirectResponse\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Redirects clients to another URL.\n",
    "- **Feature**: Used to navigate users to a different page or change routes.\n",

    "# Run the server: uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The `/redirect` route uses `RedirectResponse` to redirect to `/text`.\n",
    "- The `/text` route returns a plain text response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### curl Test Command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X GET \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/redirect\" -L\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Option Explanation**: `-L` follows redirects automatically.\n",
    "- **Expected Output**: The request to `/redirect` is redirected to `/text`, returning `\"This is Plain Text\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `RedirectResponse` in FastAPI enables efficient redirection of clients to different routes. This allows developers to dynamically manage user requests, guide them to various web pages or API endpoints, and improve usability and efficiency.\n",
