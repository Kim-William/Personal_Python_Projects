    "\n",
    "#### **1.1. What is Asynchronous Processing?**\n",
    "- A programming technique that allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently.\n",
    "- Instead of waiting for a single task to finish, other tasks can run in the background.\n",
    "- It helps reduce overall application execution time and improves resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.2. async and await**\n",
    "- **`async def`**: A keyword used to define an asynchronous function. When called, it immediately returns a coroutine object, allowing the function to run concurrently with other tasks.\n",
    "  - **What is a Future object?**\n",
    "    - Represents the result of an asynchronous operation that has not yet completed.\n",
    "    - Tracks the operation's state and provides access to the result once the operation is complete.\n",
    "    - Can hold either the final result or an exception, regardless of success or failure.\n",
    "    - Allows setting callbacks to be executed after the operation completes.\n",
    "- **`await`**: Used inside an asynchronous function to pause its execution until the awaited asynchronous operation completes. This enables other tasks to run concurrently while waiting."

    "### **2. The `asyncio` Library**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.1. Defining an Asynchronous Function with `async def`**\n",
    "- Asynchronous functions are defined with `async def`. These functions can include `await` expressions and return a coroutine object when invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.2. Waiting for Completion with `await`**\n",
    "- The `await` keyword suspends the execution of the current coroutine until the awaited operation (which must be awaitable) completes. Typically, the awaited operation is another asynchronous function defined using `async def`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.3. The Event Loop**\n",
    "- The event loop is the entry point for running asynchronous programs.\n",
    "- It is initiated with a command like `asyncio.run(main())`, which runs the provided coroutine until it finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.4. Executing Asynchronous Tasks with `asyncio.gather`**\n",
    "- `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` runs multiple coroutines concurrently and waits until all of them are complete.\n",
    "- It returns a list of results from the executed coroutines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# main_01.py\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def func1():\n",
    "    print(\"func1: Start\")\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Asynchronously wait for 2 seconds\n",
    "    print(\"func1: End\")\n",
    "\n",
    "async def func2():\n",
    "    print(\"func2: Start\")\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Asynchronously wait for 1 second\n",
    "    print(\"func2: End\")\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    await asyncio.gather(func1(), func2())  # Run func1 and func2 concurrently\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "# Run the script using: python main_01.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../source/img/12/02/01.png' width='20%'>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.5. Expected Output**\n",
    "1. Both `func1: Start` and `func2: Start` are printed almost simultaneously, indicating that both functions begin execution concurrently.\n",
    "2. Since `func2` waits for only 1 second, its \"End\" message appears before `func1`'s.\n",
    "3. After 2 seconds, `func1: End` is printed.\n",
    "- **Note:** `func1` and `func2` pause asynchronously for 2 seconds and 1 second respectively.\n",
    "- The `main` function uses `asyncio.gather` to run both functions concurrently without blocking each other.\n",
    "- `asyncio.run(main())` manages the event loop by running the `main` coroutine until completion."

    "- Enables efficient execution of multiple tasks in a single thread.\n",
    "- Particularly useful for operations with inherent latency, such as database queries or HTTP requests.\n",
    "- Asynchronous web frameworks like FastAPI can significantly improve performance for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.2. Asynchronous Features in FastAPI**\n",
    "- FastAPI natively supports asynchronous programming, allowing you to leverage libraries like `asyncio` and asynchronous versions of ORMs (e.g., SQLAlchemy).\n",
    "- **Note:** When using SQLAlchemy asynchronously, ensure you use the appropriate asynchronous syntax and patterns."
