    "#### **1.1. Basic Authentication Mechanism**\n",
    "- Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity.\n",
    "- It is critical in client-server interactions.\n",
    "- Authentication data is sent to the server via HTTP headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.2. HTTP Headers for Authentication**\n",
    "- HTTP headers play a vital role in data exchange between the client and server.\n",
    "- The `Authorization` header carries the authentication credentials.\n",
    "- Example: `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`\n",
    "  - `<credentials>` is the Base64-encoded string of \"username:password\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.3. Implementing Basic Authentication in FastAPI**\n",

    "```python\n",

    "# To run: uvicorn main_01:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTTPBasic** implements the basic authentication method.\n",
    "- The `get_current_username` function validates the username and password.\n",
    "- If the credentials are incorrect, a 401 Unauthorized error is raised.\n",
    "- The `/users/me` endpoint is accessible only to authenticated users.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **2.2. How Sessions Work**\n",
    "- Upon the first request, the server issues a unique session ID to the client.\n",
    "- The session ID is stored in a client-side cookie.\n",
    "- On subsequent requests, the cookie containing the session ID is sent to the server.\n",

    "- The `SessionMiddleware` provided by Starlette handles session management.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.2. Configuring Session Middleware**\n",
    "- Add the `SessionMiddleware` to your FastAPI application to enable session support.\n",
    "- The `secret_key` is used to encrypt session data and must be kept secure.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.3. Managing the `secret_key`**\n",
    "- Use environment variables to securely manage the secret key.\n",
    "- Ensure that the key is sufficiently long and complex.\n",
    "- Consider using key management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) if needed.\n",
    "- Regularly rotate the key as part of good security practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.4. Setting and Retrieving Session Data**\n",
    "- Use the `Request` object to store and retrieve data from the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# main_02.py\n",

    ">   - **Domain:** The domain for which the cookie is valid.\n",
    ">   - **Flag:** Indicates whether the cookie is valid for subdomains.\n",
    ">   - **Path:** The URL path for which the cookie is valid.\n",
    ">   - **Secure:** Indicates if the cookie should only be transmitted over secure connections.\n",
    ">   - **Expiration:** The expiration time of the cookie in UNIX timestamp format.\n",

    "> \n",
    "> - **Cookie Flags in curl:**  \n",
    ">   - `-c cookies.txt`: Saves cookies from the server response into `cookies.txt`.\n",
    ">   - `-b cookies.txt`: Loads cookies from `cookies.txt` and sends them with the request.\n",
